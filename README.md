## Release

- [May 13, 2024] 🔥LLaVA-Med v1.5 is out! It is not only significantly better (see the [evaluation results](docs/llava_med_performance.md#llava-med-15-performance).) but also much easier to use: no more *delta* weights! Now you can directly load our model from the [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b). The original LLaVA-Med (i.e., v1.0.0) codebase has been moved to [Archive](#archive). 
- [Nov 8, 2023]   LLaVA-Med is open-sourced under the MSR release policy. Huge thanks to commitment of the team, and patience of the community.
- [Sept, 2023]  LLaVA-Med is accepted in NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track, as a spotlight presentation.
- [June 1, 2023] 🔥 We released **LLaVA-Med: Large Language and Vision Assistant for Biomedicine**, a step towards building biomedical domain large language and vision models with GPT-4 level capabilities.  Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00890)

  *LLaVA-Med was initialized with the general-domain LLaVA and then continuously trained in a curriculum learning fashion (first biomedical concept alignment then full-blown instruction-tuning). We evaluated LLaVA-Med on standard visual conversation and question answering tasks.*

## Evaluation

### Medical Visual Chat (GPT-assisted Evaluation)

Our GPT-assisted evaluation pipeline for multimodal modeling is provided for a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of vision-language models.  Please see our paper for more details.

#### 1. Azure OpenAI Connection Info. 

Open [llava/eval/llm.py](llava/eval/llm.py?plain=1#L33) and insert your Azure OpenAI Endpoint and API KEY
```Shell
openai_cxn_dict = {
    'default': {
      'endpoint': "INSERT YOUR AZURE OPENAI ENDPOINT HERE",
      'api_key': "INSERT YOUR AZURE OPENAI API KEY HERE",
    },
  }
```
* GPT-4 inference was only tested using Azure OpenAI API. If you are using OpenAI API, you need to replace [llava/eval/llm.py (line 55)](llava/eval/llm.py?plain=1#L55) AsyncAzureOpenAI with AsyncOpenAI.

#### 2. Deployment ID
In [llava/eval/eval_multimodal_chat_gpt_score.py (line 55)](llava/eval/eval_multimodal_chat_gpt_score.py?plain=1#L55), replace with your GPT-4 model deployment id if necessary:

#### 3. Download Images

```Shell
wget https://hanoverprod.z21.web.core.windows.net/med_llava/multimodal_chat_eval/llava_med_test_image_urls.jsonl -P data/
python llava/data/download_images.py \
    --input_path data/llava_med_test_image_urls.jsonl \
    --pmc_output_path data/pmc \
    --images_output_path data/images
```

#### 4. Multimodal Chat Inference
In our case, [`llava_med_eval_qa50_qa.jsonl`](/data/eval/llava_med_eval_qa50_qa.jsonl) contains the questions, context (captions and inline-mentions) and responses generated by text-only GPT-4 (0314), which we treat as ground truth.

```Shell
PYTHONPATH=. python llava/eval/model_vqa.py \
    --conv-mode mistral_instruct \
    --model-path microsoft/llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b \
    --question-file data/eval/llava_med_eval_qa50_qa.jsonl \
    --image-folder data/images \
    --answers-file /path/to/answer-file.jsonl \
    --temperature 0.0
```

#### 5. GPT-4 Evaluation of the Generated Answers

```Shell
python llava/eval/eval_multimodal_chat_gpt_score.py \
    --answers-file /path/to/answer-file.jsonl \
    --question-file data/eval/llava_med_eval_qa50_qa.jsonl \
    --scores-file /path/to/scores-file.jsonl
```

#### 6. Summarize the Evaluation Results

```Shell
python llava/eval/summarize_gpt_review.py \
    --scores-file /path/to/scores-file.jsonl
```

## Model Description 

Large Language and Vision Assistant for bioMedicine (i.e., “LLaVA-Med”) is a large language and vision model trained using a curriculum learning method for adapting LLaVA to the biomedical domain. It is an open-source release intended for research use only to facilitate reproducibility of the corresponding paper  which claims improved performance for open-ended biomedical questions answering tasks, including common visual question answering (VQA) benchmark datasets such as PathVQA and VQA-RAD. 

### Model Uses  

#### Intended Use  

The data, code, and model checkpoints are intended to be used solely for (I) future research on visual-language processing and (II) reproducibility of the experimental results reported in the reference paper. The data, code, and model checkpoints are not intended to be used in clinical care or for any clinical decision making purposes. 

#### Primary Intended Use  

The primary intended use is to support AI researchers reproducing and building on top of this work. LLaVA-Med and its associated models should be helpful for exploring various biomedical vision-language processing (VLP ) and vision question answering (VQA) research questions. 

#### Out-of-Scope Use 

**Any** deployed use case of the model --- commercial or otherwise --- is out of scope. Although we evaluated the models using a broad set of publicly-available research benchmarks, the models and evaluations are intended *for research use only* and not intended for deployed use cases. Please refer to [the associated paper](https://aka.ms/llava-med) for more details. 

### Data 

This model builds upon [PMC-15M dataset](https://aka.ms/biomedclip-paper), which is a large-scale parallel image-text dataset for biomedical vision-language processing. It contains 15 million figure-caption pairs extracted from biomedical research articles in PubMed Central. It covers a diverse range of biomedical image types, such as microscopy, radiography, histology, and more. 

### Limitations 

This model was developed using English corpora, and thus may be considered English-only. This model is evaluated on a narrow set of biomedical benchmark tasks, described in [LLaVA-Med paper](https://aka.ms/llava-med). As such, it is not suitable for use in any clinical setting. Under some conditions, the model may make inaccurate predictions and display limitations, which may require additional mitigation strategies. In particular, this model is likely to carry many of the limitations of the model from which it is derived, [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/).

Further, this model was developed in part using the [PMC-15M](https://aka.ms/biomedclip-paper) dataset. The figure-caption pairs that make up this dataset may contain biases reflecting the current practice of academic publication. For example, the corresponding papers may be enriched for positive findings, contain examples of extreme cases, and otherwise reflect distributions that are not representative of other sources of biomedical data.
